## Background
With the advent of social media, the prevalence of people with a better physique is omnipresent. On top of which, the multiple directions that college life pulls us in, implies that some aspects of our lives will face the short end of the stick. It is often that physical exercises endure this. The inherent property of physical growth dictates the persistence in the field that cannot be substituted by just an extra long session in the gym. We personally believe that the most common hurdles for people not exercising is the fight to get started, as once we do start, with the influx of endorphins it becomes a smooth sailing.<br>
Exercise guides are present in online communities, however, one needs expertise and direction during the exact moments of their exercise as much cannot be done by just reading about the same online.

## Problem Statement
